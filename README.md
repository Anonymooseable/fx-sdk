fxSDK-ng
========

A complete (hopefully) SDK for compiling software for the CASIO fx-9860G series of calculators (SH3-based ones. Not sure how to go about the SH4s.)

_WARNING_ this git repository is not of much use, and you will probably not get anywhere using it.

See the wiki for instructions on putting together an SDK.
